# =================== Python Date types ===================

# These are the basic data types in Python.
# Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't have to explicitly declare the data type of a variable; it is inferred at runtime. Additionally, Python is an object-oriented language, and everything in Python is an object, including these data types.

# This is a (Str) 
string = 'Hello World'

# This is a (Integer) => (Int)
number = 15

# This is a (Float)
f_number = 1.56

# This is a (Bool)
status = False

# This is a (list)
list_names = ['Ali', 'Muhammad', 'Bek']

#This is a (Dictionary)
dictionary_variables = {"name": "Me", "age": "18"}

# This is a (None)
none_variables = None


# <=================== Basic Operations ===================> #


# <=================== Arithmetic Operations ===================> #

a = 10
b = 3 

print(a + b)  # (Addition)       print value = 13
print(a - b)  # (Subtraction)    print value = 7
print(a * b)  # (Multiplication) print value = 30
print(a / b)  # (Devision)       print value = 3.3333333333333335
print(a // b) # (Floor Devision) print value = 3
print(a % b)  # (Modulus)        print value = 1
print(a ** b) # (Exponentiation) print value = 1000


# <=================== Comparison Operations ===================> #

print(5 > 10)   # Greater than                result = False

print(5 < 10)   # Less than                   result = True

print(10 >= 10) # Greater than or equal to    result = True

print(5 <= 10)  # Less than or equal to       result = True

print(10 != 10) # Not equal to                result = False

print(5 == 5)   # Equal to                    result = True
